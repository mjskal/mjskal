# ABOUT ME

_After a rewarding 12.5-year journey at GoDaddy, where I recently managed the support teams for five email marketing products, I’m diving back into my entrepreneurial roots.  Before my tech career, I followed my creative passion at Berklee College of Music in Boston, which eventually led me to produce English versions of over 300 anime episodes—most noteably Bakugan Battle Brawlers and Beyblade.  These shows aired in over 100 countries, thanks to our strategic partnerships with animation and toy companies like Nelvana, Corus Entertainment, Dentsu, Spinmaster, and Hasbro._

_Later, I transitioned into tech by joining Mad Mimi, an email marketing startup, which inspired me to move west from Toronto to Vancouver.  When GoDaddy acquired us, I continued my work remotely, allowing me to follow my dreams of traveling and exploring the world—from Hong Kong to Dubai, and even trekking to Everest Base Camp in Nepal.  All the while leveraging my experience with proprietary technologies in the GoDaddy ecosystem of products which reach a user base of over 20 million._

_Now, after a decade of globetrotting and working remotely, I’m taking a career break and exploring full-stack web development. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewskal)._
